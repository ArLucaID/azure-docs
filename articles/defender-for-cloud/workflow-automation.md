# Automate responses to Microsoft Defender for Cloud triggers

Every security program includes multiple workflows for incident response. These processes might include notifying relevant stakeholders, launching a change management process, and applying specific remediation steps. Security experts recommend that you automate as many steps of those procedures as you can. Automation reduces overhead. It can also improve your security by ensuring the process steps are done quickly, consistently, and according to your predefined requirements.

This article describes the workflow automation feature of Microsoft Defender for Cloud. This feature can trigger consumption logic apps on security alerts, recommendations, and changes to regulatory compliance. For example, you might want Defender for Cloud to email a specific user when an alert occurs. You'll also learn how to create logic apps using [Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md).

## Create a logic app and define when it should automatically run

1. From Defender for Cloud's sidebar, select **Workflow automation**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/workflow-automation/list-of-workflow-automations.png" alt-text="Screenshot of workflow automation page showing the list of defined automations." lightbox="./media/workflow-automation/list-of-workflow-automations.png":::

    From this page you can create new automation rules, enable, disable, or delete existing ones.

    > [!NOTE]
    > A scope refers to the subscription where the workflow automation is deployed.

1. To define a new workflow, select **Add workflow automation**. The options pane for your new automation opens.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/workflow-automation/add-workflow.png" alt-text="Add workflow automations pane." lightbox="media/workflow-automation/add-workflow.png":::

    Here you can enter:
    1. A name and description for the automation.
    1. The triggers that will initiate this automatic workflow. For example, you might want your logic app to run when a security alert that contains "SQL" is generated.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If your trigger is a recommendation that has "sub-recommendations", for example **Vulnerability assessment findings on your SQL databases should be remediated**, the logic app will not trigger for every new security finding; only when the status of the parent recommendation changes.

    1. The consumption logic app that will run when your trigger conditions are met.

1. From the Actions section, select **visit the Logic Apps page** to begin the logic app creation process.

    :::image type="content" source="media/workflow-automation/visit-logic.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the actions section of the add workflow automation screen and the link to visit Azure Logic Apps." border="true":::

    You'll be taken to Azure Logic Apps.

1. Select **(+) Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/workflow-automation/logic-apps-create-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot of where to create a logic app." lightbox="media/workflow-automation/logic-apps-create-new.png":::

1. Fill out all required fields and select **Review + Create**.

    The message **Deployment is in progress** appears. Wait for the deployment complete notification to appear and select **Go to resource** from the notification.

1. Review the information you entered and select **Create**.

    In your new logic app, you can choose from built-in, predefined templates from the security category. Or you can define a custom flow of events to occur when this process is triggered.

    > [!TIP]
    > Sometimes in a logic app, parameters are included in the connector as part of a string and not in their own field. For an example of how to extract parameters, see step #14 of [Working with logic app parameters while building Microsoft Defender for Cloud workflow automations](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-security-center/working-with-logic-app-parameters-while-building-azure-security/ba-p/1342121).

    The logic app designer supports the following Defender for Cloud triggers:

    - **When a Microsoft Defender for Cloud Recommendation is created or triggered** - If your logic app relies on a recommendation that gets deprecated or replaced, your automation will stop working and you'll need to update the trigger. To track changes to recommendations, use the [release notes](release-notes.md).

    - **When a Defender for Cloud Alert is created or triggered** - You can customize the trigger so that it relates only to alerts with the severity levels that interest you.

    - **When a Defender for Cloud regulatory compliance assessment is created or triggered** - Trigger automations based on updates to regulatory compliance assessments.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are using the legacy trigger "When a response to a Microsoft Defender for Cloud alert is triggered", your logic apps will not be launched by the Workflow Automation feature. Instead, use either of the triggers mentioned above.

    [![Sample logic app.](media/workflow-automation/sample-logic-app.png)](media/workflow-automation/sample-logic-app.png#lightbox)

1. After you've defined your logic app, return to the workflow automation definition pane ("Add workflow automation"). Select **Refresh** to ensure your new logic app is available for selection.

    ![Refresh.](media/workflow-automation/refresh-the-list-of-logic-apps.png)

1. Select your logic app and save the automation. The logic app dropdown only shows those with supporting Defender for Cloud connectors mentioned above.

## Manually trigger a logic app

You can also run logic apps manually when viewing any security alert or recommendation.

To manually run a logic app, open an alert, or a recommendation and select **Trigger logic app**:

## Configure workflow automation at scale using the supplied policies

Automating your organization's monitoring and incident response processes can greatly improve the time it takes to investigate and mitigate security incidents.

To deploy your automation configurations across your organization, use the supplied Azure Policy 'DeployIfNotExist' policies described below to create and configure workflow automation procedures.

Get started with [workflow automation templates](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Security-Center/tree/master/Workflow%20automation).

To implement these policies:

1. From the table below, select the policy you want to apply:

    |Goal  |Policy  |Policy ID  |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |Workflow automation for security alerts              |[Deploy Workflow Automation for Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Ff1525828-9a90-4fcf-be48-268cdd02361e)|f1525828-9a90-4fcf-be48-268cdd02361e|
    |Workflow automation for security recommendations     |[Deploy Workflow Automation for Microsoft Defender for Cloud recommendations](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F73d6ab6c-2475-4850-afd6-43795f3492ef)|73d6ab6c-2475-4850-afd6-43795f3492ef|

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also find these by searching Azure Policy:
    >
    > 1. Open Azure Policy.
    > :::image type="content" source="./media/continuous-export/opening-azure-policy.png" alt-text="Accessing Azure Policy.":::
    > 2. From the Azure Policy menu, select **Definitions** and search for them by name.

1. From the relevant Azure Policy page, select **Assign**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/workflow-automation/export-policy-assign.png" alt-text="Assigning the Azure Policy.":::

1. Open each tab and set the parameters as desired:
    1. In the **Basics** tab, set the scope for the policy. To use centralized management, assign the policy to the Management Group containing the subscriptions that will use the workflow automation configuration.
    1. In the Parameters tab, enter the required information.

    :::image type="content" source="media/workflow-automation/parameters-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the parameters tab.":::

    1. (Optional), Apply this assignment to an existing subscription in the **Remediation** tab and select the option to create a remediation task.

1. Review the summary page and select **Create**.

## Data types schemas

To view the raw event schemas of the security alerts or recommendations events passed to the logic app, visit the [Workflow automation data types schemas](https://aka.ms/ASCAutomationSchemas). This can be useful in cases where you aren't using Defender for Cloud's built-in Logic Apps connectors mentioned above, but instead are using the generic HTTP connector - you could use the event JSON schema to manually parse it as you see fit.
